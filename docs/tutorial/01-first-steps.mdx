## Final outcome

After completing this tutorial, you will be familiar with the the basic concepts of web3 architecture

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic tutorial and has no prerequisites


## Steps


### Where does the code of a smart contract run?

Smart contract code runs in a blockchain in a decentralized way. But what does that even mean? Developers new to web3 often find it a very weird explanation. Code needs to run on a specific computer, right? True! The short answer is that the code runs on all the computers of the blockchain network.

The long answer involves us looking at how read/write operations are done in web2 vs web3. But first, we need to understand what a blockchain actually is.

A Blockchain network is a distributed network of computers. Each computer runs blockchain software such as Flow. The computers all share the same data and state. Consistency is maintained through a consensus mechanism.

### Reading data from a blockchain

To read data from the blockchain, you query one computer or node on the network and ask it to read data from a specific smart contract.

To do this, you can run your own node or use a Mode Provider API Service.

### Writing data to a blockchain

Writing data to the blockchain is a little bit more complicated. It is done via transactions to the network. These transactions describe which smart contract you want to modify and which function you want to execute.  Transactions may also include any arguments and/or cryptocurrency being sent to the function. 

The transaction will then be signed and sent to the Flow network. Signing transactions in web3 is somewhat similar to API keys in web2. It proves who you are and what permissions you have.

Transactions are sent to specific nodes (i.e Individual computers running the flow software). This receiving node will then relay your transaction to theh other flow nodes, some of which are miners.

Miners receive your transaction and store it in a bucket/waitinglist called a transaction pool. A transaction pool is a group of transactions ready to be added to the blockchain. The miner then runs all the transactions in its pool. 

Transactions are run one by one, taking a transaction, executing the function of a smart contract, and modifying the state of the blockchain. The miner node does this over and over until it has run through all the transactions in its pool. All miners do this at the same time. This is what we mean when we say that smart contract code runs in a decentralized way.

It Is important to note that each miner has a different set or order of transactions. This means that the final state of the blockchain is not yet certain. Only after a single miner has "solved" the block will its set or order of transactions be accepted by the network as a whole. Only then will the transactions be "fully confirmed" and added to the blockchain.
