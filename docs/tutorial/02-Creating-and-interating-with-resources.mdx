## Learning expectations

After this tutorial, you will be able to create and interact with resources in Cadence.

## Pre-requisites

In order to follow along with this tutorial, you need to be familiar with [Tutorial 1](/cadence/tutorial/01-first-steps-Hello-World.mdx) which covers creating and deploying smart contracts in Cadence.

## Steps

### Creating a resource

In this tutorial, we are going to get some practice with an example that uses **[resources](/cadence/language/resources/)**,
one of the defining features in Cadence. A resource is a composite type like a struct or a class, but with some special rules.

<Callout type="info">

Open the Account `0x02` tab with file named `HelloWorldResource.cdc`. <br />
`HelloWorldResource.cdc` should contain the following code:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=HelloWorldResource.cdc
pub contract HelloWorld {

  // Declare a resource that only includes one function.
  pub resource HelloAsset {
    // A transaction can call this function to get the "Hello, World!"
    // message from the resource.
    pub fun hello(): String {
      return "Hello, World!"
    }
  }

  init() {
    // Use the create built-in function to create a new instance
    // of the HelloAsset resource
    let newHello <- create HelloAsset()

    // We can do anything in the init function, including accessing
    // the storage of the account that this contract is deployed to.
    //
    // Here we are storing the newly created HelloAsset resource
    // in the private account storage
    // by specifying a custom path to the resource
    // Make sure the path is specific to avoid path collision!
    self.account.save(<-newHello, to: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)

    log("HelloAsset created and stored")
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Deploy this code to account `0x02` using the `Deploy` button.

</Callout>

This is another example of what we can do with a contract.
Cadence can declare type definitions within deployed contracts.
A type definition is simply a description of how a particular set of data is organized.
It isn't a copy of that data on its own. 
Any account can import these definitions and use them to create an object that follows that definition or to
interact with other objects of those types.

This contract that we just deployed declares a definition for the `HelloAsset` resource.

Let's walk through this contract, starting with the resource. Resources are one of the most important things
that Cadence introduces to the smart contract design experience:

```cadence
pub resource HelloAsset {
    pub fun hello(): String {
        return "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```

Resources are a composite type similar to a struct or a class because they can have any number of fields or functions within them.
The difference is how code is allowed to interact with them.

- Each instance of a resource can only exist in exactly one location and cannot be copied.
  Here, location refers to account storage, a temporary variable in a function, a storage field in a contract, etc.
- Resources must be explicitly moved from one location to another when accessed.
- Resources also cannot go out of scope at the end of function execution.
  They must be explicitly stored somewhere or destroyed.

These characteristics make it impossible to accidentally lose a resource from a coding mistake.

Resources are useful when you want to model direct ownership.
Traditional structs or classes from other conventional programming languages
are not an ideal way to represent ownership because they can be *copied*.
This means a coding error can easily result in creating multiple copies of the same asset,
which breaks the scarcity requirements needed for these assets to have real value.
We have to consider loss and theft at the scale of a house, a car, or a bank account with millions of dollars, or a horse.
Resources, in turn, solve this problem by making creation, destruction, and movement of assets explicit.

```cadence
init() {
// ...
```

This example also declares an `init()` function. All composite types like contracts, resources, and structs can have an optional `init()` function
that only runs when the object is initially created. Cadence requires that all fields must be explicitly initialized,
so if the object has any fields, this function has to be used to initialize them.

Contracts also have read and write access to the storage of the account that they are deployed to
by using the built-in [`self.account`](/cadence/language/contracts) object.
This is an [`AuthAccount` object](/cadence/language/accounts/#authaccount)
that gives them access to many different functions to interact with the private storage of the account.

In this contract's `init` function, the contract uses the `create` keyword
to create an instance of the `HelloAsset` type and saves it to a local variable.
To create a new resource object, we use the `create` keyword
followed by an invocation of the name of the resource with any `init()` arguments.

**A resource can only be created in the scope that it is defined in.**

This prevents anyone from being able to create arbitrary amounts of resource objects that others have defined.

#### The Move Operator (`<-`)

```cadence
let newHello <- create HelloAsset()
```

Here we use the `<-` symbol. [This is the move operator](/cadence/language/resources/#themoveoperator).
The move operator `<-` replaces the assignment operator `=` in assignments that involve resources.
To make the assignment of resources explicit, the move operator `<-` must be used when:

- the resource is the initial value of a constant or variable,
- the resource is moved to a different variable in an assignment,
- the resource is moved to a function as an argument
- the resource is returned from a function.

When a resource is moved, the old location is invalidated, and the object moves into the context of the new location.

So if I have a resource in `first_resource`, like so:

```cadence
// Note the `@` symbol to specify that it is a resource
let first_resource: @AnyResource = create AnyResource()
```

and I want to assign it to a new variable, `second_resource`,
after I do the assignment, `first_resource` is invalid because the underlying resource has been moved to the new variable.

```cadence
var second_resource <- first_resource
// first_resource is now invalid. Nothing can be done with it
```

Regular assignments of resources are not allowed because assignments only copy the value.
Resources can only exist in one location at a time, so movement must be explicitly shown in the code.



Back to our `init` function, after creating the `HelloAsset` resource,
it uses the `AuthAccount.save` function to store the resource in the account storage.

```cadence
self.account.save(<-newHello, to: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)
```

A contract can refer to its member functions and fields with the keyword `self`.
All contracts have access to the storage of the account where they are deployed and can access that `AuthAccount` object with `self.account`.

`AuthAccount` objects have many different methods that are used to interact with account storage.
You can see the documentation for all of these in the [account section of the language reference](/cadence/language/accounts/#authaccount).
The `save` method saves an object to account storage. The type parameter for the object type
is contained in `<>` to indicate what type the stored object is.
It can also be inferred from the argument's type, but it is often safe to be explicit anyway.

The first parameter to `save` is the object that is being stored, and the `to` parameter is the path that the object is being stored at.
The path must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `/storage/` is allowed as the `to` parameter.

If there is already an object stored under the given path, the program aborts.
Remember, the Cadence type system ensures that a resource can never be accidentally lost.
When moving a resource to a field, into an array, into a dictionary, or into storage,
there is the possibility that the location already contains a resource.
Cadence forces the developer to handle the case of an existing resource so that it is not accidentally lost through an overwrite.

It is also very important when choosing the name of your paths to pick an identifier
that is very specific and unique to your project. Currently, account storage paths are global,
so there is a chance that projects could use the same storage paths, which could cause path conflicts!
This could be a headache for you, so choose unique path names to avoid this problem.

Try removing the line of code that saves `newHello` to storage.
You should see an error for `newHello` that says `loss of resource`.
This means that you are not handling the resource properly.
If you ever see this error in any of your programs, it means there is a resource somewhere
that is not being explicitly stored or destroyed, meaning the program is invalid.

Add the line back to make the contract check properly.

In this case, this is the first transaction we have run with the selected account,
so we know that the storage spot at `/storage/HelloAssetTutorial` is empty.
In real applications, we would likely perform necessary checks and actions with the location we are storing to
to make sure we don't abort the transaction because of an accidental overwrite.

Now that you have deployed the contract, account `0x02` should have the newly created `HelloWorld.HelloAsset`
resource stored in its storage. Let's check to make sure this is true with a transaction.

### Interacting with a resource

<Callout type="info">

Open the transaction named `Load Hello`.

<br />

`Load Hello` should contain the following code:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=LoadHello.cdc
import HelloWorld from 0x02

// This transaction calls the "hello" method on the HelloAsset object
// that is stored in the account's storage by removing that object
// from storage, calling the method, and then putting it back in storage

transaction {

    prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {

        // load the resource from storage, specifying the type to load it as
        // and the path where it is stored
        let helloResource <- acct.load<@HelloWorld.HelloAsset>(from: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)

        // We use optional chaining (?) because the value in storage
        // may or may not exist, and thus is considered optional.
        log(helloResource?.hello())

        // Put the resource back in storage at the same spot
        // We use the force-unwrap operator `!` to get the value
        // out of the optional. It aborts if the optional is nil
        acct.save(<-helloResource!, to: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)
    }
}
```

This transaction imports the `HelloWorld` definitions from the account we just deployed them to, removes the `HelloAsset` object from storage,
and calls the `hello()` function of the stored `HelloAsset` resource.

This transaction also is our first to use the `prepare` phase!
The `prepare` phase is the only place that has access to the signing accounts' [private `AuthAccount` object](/cadence/language/accounts/#authaccount).
`AuthAccount` has special methods that allow saving to and loading from `/storage/`,
and creating `/private/` and `/public/` links to the objects in `/storage/`,
called [capabilities](/cadence/language/capability-based-access-control) (more on these later).

The `execute` phase does not have access to `AuthAccount` and thus can only use objects
that were removed from the `AuthAccount` in the `prepare` phase or created in the `prepare` phase.

By not allowing the execute phase to access account storage,
we can statically verify which assets and areas of the signers' storage a given transaction can modify.
Browser wallets and applications that submit transactions for users can use this to show what a transaction could alter,
giving users information about transactions that wallets will be executing for them, and confidence that they aren't getting fed
a malicious or dangerous transaction from an app or wallet.

You can have multiple signers of a transaction by clicking multiple account avatars in the playground,
but the number of parameters of the prepare block of the transaction
NEEDS to be the same as the number of signers. If not, this will cause an error.

To remove an object from storage, we use the `load` method.

```cadence
let helloResource <- acct.load<@HelloWorld.HelloAsset>(from: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)
```

If no object of the specified type is stored under the given path, the function returns `nil`. (This is an [Optional](/cadence/language/values-and-types/#optionals),
a special type of data that we will cover later)

If there is an object of the specified type at the path, the function returns that object
and the storage will no longer contain an object under the given path.

The type parameter for the object type to load is contained in `<>`.
A type argument for the parameter must be provided explicitly, which is `@HelloWorld.HelloAsset` here.
(Note the `@` symbol to specify that it is a resource)

The path `from` must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `/storage/` is allowed.

Next, we call the `hello` function and log the output.

```cadence
log(helloResource?.hello())
```

We use `?` because the values in the storage are returned as [optionals](/cadence/language/values-and-types/#optionals).
Optionals are values that can represent the absence of a value.
Optionals have two cases: either there is a value of the specified type, or there is nothing (`nil`).
An optional type is declared using the `?` suffix.

```cadence
let newResource: HelloAsset?  // could either have a value of type `HelloAsset`
                              // or it could have a value of `nil`
```

Optionals allow developers to account for `nil` cases more gracefully.
Here, we explicitly have to account for the possibility that the `helloResource` object we got with `load` is `nil`
(because `load` will return `nil` if there is nothing there to load).

Using `?` "unwraps" the optional, meaning that it gets the value if it is there, before calling `hello`,
but only if the value isn't `nil`. If the value is nil, the `?` returns `nil`.

Because `?` is used when calling the `hello` function, the function call only happens if the stored value is not `nil`.
In this case, the result of the `hello` function will be returned as an optional.
However, if the stored value was `nil`, the function call would not occur and the result is `nil`.

Next, we use `save` again to put the object back in storage in the same spot:

```cadence
acct.save(<-helloResource!, to: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)
```

Remember, `helloResource` is still an optional, so we have to handle the possibility that it is `nil`.
Here, we use the force-unwrap operator (`!`). This operator gets the value in the optional if it contains a value,
and aborts the entire transaction if the object is `nil`.
It is a more risky way of dealing with optionals, but if your program is ever in a state where a value being `nil`
would defeat the purpose of the whole transaction, then the force-unwrap operator might be a good choice to deal with that.

Refer to [Optionals In Cadence](/cadence/language/values-and-types/#optionals) to learn more about optionals and how they are used.

<Callout type="info">

Select account `0x02` as the only signer. Click the `Send` button to submit
the transaction.

</Callout>

You should see something like this:

```
"Hello, World!"
```

### Creating Capabilities and References to Stored Resources

---

In this example, we create a link and reference to your `HelloAsset` resource object, then use that reference to call the `hello` function.
A detailed explanation of what is happening in this transaction is below the transaction code so, if you feel lost, keep reading!

<Callout type="info">

Open the transaction named `Create Link`.

<br />

`Create Link` should contain the following code:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=CreateLink
import HelloWorld from 0x02

// This transaction creates a new capability
// for the HelloAsset resource in storage
// and adds it to the account's public area.
//
// Other accounts and scripts can use this capability
// to create a reference to the private object to be able to
// access its fields and call its methods.

transaction {
  prepare(account: AuthAccount) {

    // Create a public capability by linking the capability to
    // a `target` object in account storage.
    // The capability allows access to the object through an
    // interface defined by the owner.
    // This does not check if the link is valid or if the target exists.
    // It just creates the capability.
    // The capability is created and stored at /public/Hello, and is
    // also returned from the function.
    let capability = account.link<&HelloWorld.HelloAsset>(/public/HelloAssetTutorial, target: /storage/HelloAssetTutorial)

    // Use the capability's borrow method to create a new reference
    // to the object that the capability links to
    // We use optional chaining "??" to get the value because
    // result of the borrow could fail, so it is an optional.
    // If the optional is nil,
    // the panic will happen with a descriptive error message
    let helloReference = capability.borrow()
      ?? panic("Could not borrow a reference to the hello capability")

    // Call the hello function using the reference
    // to the HelloAsset resource.
    //
    log(helloReference.hello())
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Ensure account `0x02` is still selected as a transaction signer. <br />
Click the `Send` button to send the transaction.

</Callout>

You should see `"Hello, World"` show up in the console again.
You might be confused that we were able to call a method on the `HelloAsset` object
without actually being directly in control of it!
It is also stored in the `/storage/` domain of the account, which should be private.

This is because we created a [**capability**](/cadence/language/capability-based-access-control/) for the `HelloAsset` object.
Capabilities are kind of like pointers in other languages.
